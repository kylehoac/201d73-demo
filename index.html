            My name is Kyle Hoac, and I am an aspire software engineer and web developer studying with Code Fellows. For a short period of time, I was enrolled at UMass Dartmouth studying Business Management, however I got an amazing opportunity to work as a BDC Manager/Internet + Floor Salesman hybrid at a Volkswagen dealership, and took that opportunity instead (easily the best decision of my life to date). My main objective as of right now is to see whether or not Software Development is a viable path for me, and see where I can take it from there.
