            My name is Kyle Hoac, and I am an aspire software engineer and web developer studying with Code Fellows.
        </p>

        <p>
            For a short period of time, I was enrolled at UMass Dartmouth studying Business Management, however I got an amazing opportunity to work as a BDC Manager/Internet + Floor Salesman hybrid at a Volkswagen dealership, and took that opportunity instead (easily the best decision of my life to date). 
        </p>
    </br>
        <p>
            My main objective as of right now is to see whether or not Software Development is a viable path for me, and see where I can take it from there.
